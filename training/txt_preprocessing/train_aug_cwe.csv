6,"preoperative diagnosis :, left acoustic neuroma., postoperative diagnosis :, left acoustic neuroma., procedure performed :, left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma., anesthesia :, general., operative findings :, this patient had a 3 - cm acoustic neuroma. the tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve. the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0. 05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections., procedure in detail :, following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery. she was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with mayfield pins. the left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion. transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed, and no response was verified. the proposed incision was injected with 1 % xylocaine with epinephrine. next, t - shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease. the incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use., incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip. periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone. emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax. bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure. using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed. the sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly. from these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed. bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use. the bone flap was also left at the site for further use. dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base. some bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus. there was extensively aerated temporal bone. at this point, dr. trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor. the cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure. once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone. the dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone. then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out. the bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm. there was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well. the dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult. therefore, dr. trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor. with dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem. the eighth nerve was identified and transected. tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem. the facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well. it was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve. attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed. the superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus. at this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct. the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated. the tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor. the nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face. further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally. however, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated. however, the tumor was then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness. it was released from the brainstem ventrally. the tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0. 05 milliamperes. overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume. at this point, dr. trask re - inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis. the air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax. a piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect. next, the dura was closed with duragen and duraseal. the bone flap and bone * * * * * were then placed in the bone defect. postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3 - 0 vicryl sutures. the skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3 - 0 vicryl sutures. running 4 - 0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels. sterile mastoid dressing was then placed. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the pacu in a stable condition. all counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure., estimated blood loss :, 100 ml.", Neurology

15,"preoperative diagnoses :, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and recurrent biliary colic., postoperative diagnoses :, severe cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and morbid obesity., procedures performed :, laparoscopy, laparotomy, cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram, choledocholithotomy with operative choledochoscopy and t - tube drainage of the common bile duct., anesthesia :, general., indications :, this is a 63 - year - old white male patient with multiple medical problems including hypertension, diabetes, end - stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and the patient is on hemodialysis, who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric right upper quadrant pain. the patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission. he was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance. however, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain. the patient had a hida scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction. because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram. possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient. the procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained., description of procedure :, the patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia. the entire abdomen was prepped and draped. a small transverse incision was made about 2 - 1 / 2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia. the patient has a rather long torso. fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia. peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with co2. laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area. the patient was placed in reverse trendelenburg and partially rotated to the left. an 11 - mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5 - mm in the right subcostal region. slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area. initially, i was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver. then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection / inflammation. the visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra - abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick. after evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy. the trocars were removed., a right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered. a bookwalter retractor was put in place. the dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver. eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it. dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size. the duodenum was kocherized. the gallbladder was partly intrahepatic. because of this, i decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem. the inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1. 5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder., it was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was. eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, i did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short. intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using c - arm fluoroscopy. this showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone. at this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration. the common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4 - 0 vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out. after some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct. so, it was about a 1 - cm size stone, which was removed. following this, a 10 - french red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously. no further stones were obtained. the catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of vater. at this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, i did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree. however, a stone was found distally still floating around. this was removed with stone forceps. the bile ducts were irrigated again. no further stones were removed. a 16 - french t - tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the t - tube using 4 - 0 vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure. a completion t - tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, i was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area. because of this, the t - tube was removed, and i passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and i was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area. i felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct. the bile duct lumen was widely open. t - tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion t - tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time. the cystic duct opening through which i had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure - of - eight suture of 2 - 0 vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area., the remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining. subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. hemostasis was good. a 10 - mm jackson - pratt drain was left in the foramen of winslow and brought out through the lateral 5 - mm port site. the t - tube was brought out through the middle 5 - mm port site, which was just above the incision. abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and # 1 novafil running suture for the fascia. subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3 - 0 vicryl running sutures in two layers. subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 ml of 0. 25 % marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control. the umbilical incision was closed with 0 vicryl figure - of - eight sutures for the fascia, 2 - 0 vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues, and staples for the skin. sterile dressing was applied, and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.", Gastroenterology

arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement. it is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement. once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella. once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide. a charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee. at this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size f. once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur. at this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation. our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues. next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus. this was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed. at this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed. this was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking. at this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues. an oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut. peg holes were then drilled., the block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces. at this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide. this was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia. at this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy. prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection. at this time, a _ blunt kocher and bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments. once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size f to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface. the knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation. the patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release. distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis. at this time, an intraoperative x - ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut. at this time, the prosthesis was removed. a mcgill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia. once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components. at this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed. the cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component. the component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed. in a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed. a 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content. once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone. once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry. the knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as # 14. the # 14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion. we decided to go with a # 12 mm polyethylene tray. at this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place. this was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia. the knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact. a drain was placed and cut to length., at this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried. # 1 -

tenosynovitis., 3. massive rotator cuff tear in left shoulder ( full thickness subscapularis tendon rupture 3 cm x 4 cm ; supraspinatus tendon rupture 3 cm x 3 cm ; infraspinatus tear 2 cm x 2 cm )., description of procedure :, the patient was anesthetized in the supine position, a foley catheter was placed in his bladder. he was then placed beach chair position and all bony prominences were well padded. pillows were placed around his knees to protect his sciatic nerve. he was brought to the side of the table and secured with towels and tape. the head was placed in neutral position with no lateral bending or extension to protect the brachioplexus from any stretch. left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. unfortunately, preoperative antibiotics were given prior to the procedure. this occurred due to lack of communication between the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff. the patient's extremity, however, was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine prep after he had been previously draped. also, ioban bandages were placed securely to the skin to prevent any further introduction of infection into his shoulder., deltopectoral incision was then made. the patient's had a cephalic vein, it was identified and protected throughout the case. it was retracted laterally and once this has been completed, the deltopectoral interval was developed as carefully as possible. the patient did have significant scar from this point on and did bleed from many surfaces throughout the case. as a result, he was transfused 1 unit postoperatively. he did not have any problems during the case except for one small drop of blood pressure. however this was due primarily because of the extensive scarring of his proximal humerus. he had scar between the anterior capsular structures and the conjoint tendon. also there was significant scar between the deltoid and the proximal humerus. the deltoid was very carefully and tediously removed from the proximal humerus in order not to damage the axillary nerve. once the plane between the deltoid and underlying tissue was found, the proximal humerus was discovered to have a large defect, approximately 4 x 3. this was covered by rimmed fibrous tissue which was fairly compressible, which felt to be purulent, however, when the needle was stuck into this area, there was no return of fluid. as a result, this was finally opened and found to have fibrinous exudates which appeared to be old congealed, purulent material. there was some suggestion of a synovitis type reaction also inside this cystic area. this was all debrided but was found to track all the way into the proximal humerus from the lateral femoral component and also tracked posteriorly through and around the posterior cortex of the proximal humerus indicating that the infraspinatus probably had some tearing and detachment. this later proved to be the case and infraspinatus did indeed have a tear 2 cm x 2 cm. all of the mucinous material and fibrinous material was removed from the proximal humerus. this was fairly extensive debridement. all of this was sent to pathology and also sent for culture and sensitivity. it should be noted that gram stain became as multiple white blood cells but no organism seen. the pathology came back as fibrinous material with multiple white cells, also with signs of chronic inflammation consistent with an infection., attention was then directed towards the anterior structures to gain access to the joint so that we could dislocate the prosthesis and remove it. there was also cystic area in the anterior aspect of the shoulder which was fairly fibrinous. this was also removed. once this was removed, though the capsule was found to be very thin, there was essentially no subscapularis tendon whatsoever. it should also noted the patient's proximal humerus was subluxed superiorly so that there was no supraspinatus tendon present whatsoever. as a result, the biceps tendon was finally identified just below the pectoralis tendon insertion. the upper 1 or 2 cm of the pectoralis insertion was released in order to find the biceps. it was tracked proximally and transverse ligament released. the biceps tendon was flat and somewhat erythematous. as a result, it released and tagged with an 0 vicryl suture. it was later tenodesed to the conjoint tendon using 2 - 0 prolene sutures. the joint was then entered and noted significant synovitis throughout the entire glenoid. this was all very carefully removed using a rongeur and sharp dissection., next, the humeral component was removed and this was done by attempting to remove it with the slap hammer and device which comes with the biomet set. unfortunately, this device would not hold the proximal humerus and we could not get the component to release. as a result, bone contact of the metal proximally was released using a straight osteotome. once this was completed, another attempt was made to remove the prosthesis but this only resulted in fracture of the proximal humerus through the areas of erosion of the infection and once this has been completed, we abandoned use of that particular device and using a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _, we were able to hit the prosthesis lip from beneath and essentially remove it. there was no cement. there was exudate within the canal which was removed using a curette., using fluoroscopy, sequential reamers were placed to a size of 11 distally down the shaft to remove the exudate. this was also thoroughly irrigated with irrigation antibiotic, and impregnated irrigation to decrease any risk of infection. it should be noted that the reaming was done fluoroscopically to make sure that there was no penetration of the canal at any point., the attention was then directed to the glenoid. the glenoid component was very carefully dissected free and found to be very loose. it was essentially removed with digital dissection. there was no remaining cement in the cavity itself. the patient's glenoid was very carefully debrided. the glenoid itself was found to be very cup shaped with significant amount of bone loss in the central portion of the canal itself. this was debrided using rongeurs and curette until there was no purulent exudate present anywhere in the glenoid itself., next, the entire wound was irrigated thoroughly with 9 liters of antibiotic impregnated irrigation. rather than place a spacer, it was elected to use antiobiotic beads. this was with antibiotic impregnated cement with one package with 3 gram of vancomycin. these beads were then connected using prolene and placed into the glenoid cavity itself, also some were placed in the greater tuberosity region. these three did not have a prolene attached to them. the ones placed down the canal did have a prolene used as did the ones placed in the cavity of the glenoid itself., the biceps tendon was then tenodesed under tension to the conjoint tendon. there was essentially no capsule left purely to close over the proximal humerus. it was electively the proximal humerus. a portion of bone intact because it did have some bleeding surfaces. deltopectoral was then closed with 0 - vicryl sutures, the deep subcutaneous tissues with 0 - vicryl sutures, superficial subcutaneous tissues with 2 - 0 vicryl sutures. skin was closed with staples. a sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and shoulder immobilizer. the patient was sent to recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition., it should be noted that _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is being requested for this case. this was a significantly scarred patient which required extra dissection and attention. even though this was a standard revision case due to infection, there was a significant more decision making and technical challenges in this case and this was present for typical revision case. similarly, this case took approximately 30 to 40 % more length of

minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra. the bladder was subsequently drained with a red robinson catheter. at that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space. care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture. at that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies. attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant. this was dissected out bluntly and sharply with metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis. at this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing contract was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prost ##hesis. as we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery. at that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum. this was brought up into _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two # 3 - 0 prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body. the corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty. however, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures. this was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body. the left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted. after removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen. both corporal bodies were then dilated with the pratt dilators. these were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces. at this point, using the farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally. he had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed. we decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis. confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest. we felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm. at this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the farlow device and the keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty. attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders. this then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the farlow device through the glans penis. there was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea. the rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with # 2 -

0 vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty. the entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated. after completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ with good cosmetic result. at that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic. the soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers. the soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples. please also note that prior to the skin closure, a jackson -

arm ) was brought into position and the t12 pedicles were identified and marked with a positive skin marker. in view of the collapse of t12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate. an 11 - gauge needle was advanced through the t12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side. positioning was confirmed on the ap and lateral plane. following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed. a guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex. ap and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory. alongside of the guide pin a 1 - cm paramedian incision was made. the needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place. the osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle. once i was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall. through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel. the anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex. after completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex. the radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using ap and lateral images. the above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the t12 vertebral body. once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0. 5 cc and 50 psi. expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0. 25 to 0. 5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position. the inflation was monitored with ap and lateral imaging. the final balloon volume was 3. 5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left. there was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved. under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low - pressure injection of kyphon hv - r bone cement. the cavity was filled with a total volume of 3. 5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side. once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed., at this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at l1 using the same sequence of steps as on t12. an entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved. throughout the procedure, ap and lateral imaging monitored positioning., post -

c5 and c5 - c6. there was also noted to be some annular bulges at c3 - c4, and c6 - c7. the ct scan in march revealed that the fusion was not fully solid. x - rays were done in november including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid., the patient had been on pain medication. the patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments. he was given the option of surgical intervention. we discussed botox, i discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression. i explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery. if at the time of surgery there was some motion of the c4 - c5 level, i would recommend a fusion. the patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking. i have therefore recommended him that he use iliac bone graft. i explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life. even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely., the patient also was advised that if i did a fusion, i would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire. the wire would be left permanently., even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve. his numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist. he still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure. other procedures may be necessary later. there is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function. he could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life. he could develop chronic regional pain syndromes. he could get difficulty swallowing or eating. he could have substantial weakness in the arm. he was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting., he was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that dr. x would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery., he stated he understood all the risks. he did not wish to get any other treatments. he said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery., procedure in detail :, in the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia., i then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls. his head was controlled by a horseshoe holder. the anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes. the arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped. care was taken to position both arms and both legs. pulses were checked., a midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine. a loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used. bleeding vessels were cauterized. meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure. gradually and carefully i exposed the spinous process of the c6, c5, and c4. a lateral view was done after an instrument in place. this revealed the c6 - c7 level. i therefore did a small laminotomy opening at c4 - c5. i placed an instrument and x - rays confirmed c4 - c5 level., i stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self - retaining retractor., once i identified the level, i then used a bur to thin the lamina of c5. i used a 1 - mm, followed by a 2 - mm kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off c5 on the left. i removed some of the superior lamina of c6 and some of the inferior lamina of c4. this allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the c5 and c6 nerve roots. there was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used. absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal. there was no retraction. i was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found., at the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent. the nerve roots had been fully decompressed., i then checked stability. there was micromotion at the c4 - c5 level. i therefore elected to proceed with a fusion., i debrided the interspinous ligament between c4 and c5. i used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of c5 and the inferior portion of c4. using a small drill, i opened the facet at c4 - c5. i then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage. i used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at c4 - c5., attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped. an incision made over the iliac crest. bleeding vessels were cauterized. i exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest. i removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone., i placed the songer wire through the base of the spinous process of c4 and c5. drill holes made with a clip. i then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process. i then tightened the songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire., prior to tightening the wire, i also packed cancellous bone with facet at c4 - c5. i then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of c4 and c5., the hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and kantrex. deep structures were closed with # 1 vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed., no drain was placed in the hip., a drain was left in the posterior cervical spine. the deep tissues were closed with 0 vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed. the patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.", Orthopedic

month - old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites. the patient has been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces. last week, dr. x took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically. however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen. dr. x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole. this was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease. we met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt., operative findings :, the patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended. exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity. what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon. it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of eliminating the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery. there was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be gross ##ly involved, but i did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option. instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that., the lymphatic abnormality was extensive. they were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery. they were small aneurysm - like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well. no other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified. both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well., description of operation :, the patient was brought from the pediatric intensive care unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow. we conducted a surgical time - out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above. preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia. as the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described. the bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites. the small bowel from the ligament of treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75 % of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for the patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems. furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option. we suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4 -

sex attractions. third, screening for stds must take into account sexual behaviors. although urine - based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections. if a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out stds. fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms. as his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current std, performing an hiv test should be part of the standard evaluation. in addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, pcr testing should also be considered. the care provided to this young man included the following. he was treated presumptively for proctitis with both im ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis. ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant n gonorrhoeae. at the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent - specific hiv program. the case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support. the case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later. over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his hiv infection., set # 1 cd4 t -

ray was taken and demonstrated a needle at the t12 - l1 interspace. an incision was made over the posterior spinous process of t10, t11, t12, l1, and l2. a weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of t10, t11, t12, l1, and l2. an additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting bovie current osteotome and cobb elevator. the cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at t12 was apparent. initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in t11 and l1. the inferior articular facet was removed at t11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle. placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy. the awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of t11. a 40 - mm click'x screw, 6. 5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the wound t11 verte ##bral body., attention was next turned to the l1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra - articular process was located using an am - 8 dissecting tool, am attachment to the midas rex instrumentation. the area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in l1. using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of l1 and a 7 - mm diameter 45 - mm in length click'x synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the l1 vertebral body., at this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the mri findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side. attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at t12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis. the anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the t12 was incised with cutting bovie current and the posterior spinous process at t12 removed with a leksell rongeur. it was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at t11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at t12., at this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45 - degree kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and leksell rongeur. there was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the t12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the t11 - t12 interlaminar space. additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at t12 and l1. these facets were removed with 45 - degree kerrison rongeur and leksell rongeur. bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45 - degree kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed. the exiting nerve roots at t11 and t12 were visualized and followed with frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free. hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation., at this point, a frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the t11 - t12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile. a # 4 penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac. copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at t11 and l1 using the technique described for a left - sided pedicle screw placement. the anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at t11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for t11 and at l1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra - articular process and the facet joint., with the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed. it was felt that distraction was not necessary. a 75 - mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place ; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90 - mm rod. the locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld. fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at t11 - t12 or t12 - l1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws. a crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened., it should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at t11, t12, and l1 with am - 8 dissecting tool, am attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints. this was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods., following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters. gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 vicryl suture. the fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2 -

ray was performed in the emergency room, which revealed a grade iv hawkins classification talus fracture. he was distal neurovascularly intact. the patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle., it was for this reason, we elected to undergo the above - named procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body. because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis. the patient has agreed to undergo the above - named procedure and consent was obtained. all risks as well as complications were discussed., procedure :, the patient was brought back to operative room # 4 of abcd general hospital on 08 / 20 / 03. a spinal anesthetic was administered. a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated. he was then positioned on the beanbag. the extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure. an esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmhg. at this time, an anteromedial incision was made in order to perform a medial malleolus osteotomy to help best localize the fracture region in order to be able to bone graft the comminuted fracture site. at this time, a # 15 blade was used to make approximately 10 cm incision over the medial malleolus. this was curved anteromedial along the root of the saphenous vein. the saphenous vein was located. its tributaries going plantar were cauterized and the vein was retracted anterolaterally. at this time, we identified the medial malleolus. there was evidence of approximately 80 % avulsion, rupture of the deltoid ligament off of the medial malleolus. this was a major blood feeder to the medial malleolus and we were concerned, once we were going to do the osteotomy, that this would later create healing problem. it is for this reason that the pedicle, which was attached to the medial malleolus, was left intact. this pedicle was the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament. at this time, a microchoice saw was then used to make a box osteotomy of the medial malleolus. once this was performed, the medial malleolus was retracted anterolaterally with its remaining pedicle intact for later blood supply. this provided us with excellent exposure to the fracture site of the medial side. at this time, any loose comminuted pieces were removed. the dome of the talus was also checked and did not reveal any osteochondral defects. there was some comminution on the dorsal aspect of the complete talus fracture and we were concerned that once we place the screw, this would tend to extend the fracture site. it is for this reason, we did the medial malleolar osteotomy to prevent this from happening in order to best expose the fracture site. at this time, a reduction was performed. the # 7 - 0 partially threaded cannulated screws were used in order to fix the fracture. at this time, a 3. 2 mm guidewire was placed going from posterolateral to anteromedial., this was placed slightly lateral to the achilles tendon, percutaneously inserted, and then drilled in the according fashion across the fracture site. once this was performed, a skin knife was then used to incise over the percutaneous insertion in order to accommodate the screw going in. a depth gauze was then used to measure screw length. a cannulated drill was then used to drill across the fracture site to allow the entrance of the screw. a 55 mm partially threaded # 7 - 0 cannulated screw was then placed with excellent compression at the fracture site. once this was obtained, we checked the reduction again using intraoperative xi - scan in the ap and lateral direction. this projection gave us excellent view of our screw placement and excellent compression across the fracture site. at this time, we bone grafted the area of comminution using 1 cc of dynagraft with crushed cancellous allograft. this was placed using a freer elevator into the fracture site where the comminution was. at this time, we copiously irrigated the wound. the osteotomy site was then repaired, first clamped using two large tenaculum reduction clamps. two partially threaded # 4 - 0 cannulated screws were then used to fix the osteotomy site and anatomical reduction was performed with excellent compression across the osteotomy site with the two screws. next, a # 1 - 0 vicryl was then used to repair the deltoid ligament, which was ruptured via the injury. a tight repair was performed of the deltoid ligament. at this time, again copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound. a # 2 - 0 vicryl was then used to approximate the subcutaneous skin and staples for the skin incision. at this time, the leg was cleansed, adaptic, 4 x 4, and kerlix roll were then applied. the patient was then placed in a plaster splint for mobilization. the tourniquet was then released. the patient was then transferred off the operating table to recovery in stable condition. the prognosis for this fracture is guarded. there is a high rate of avascular necrosis of the talar body, approximately anywhere from 40 -

year - old caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries. up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy., procedure in detail :, the patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic - assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out. after institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated. great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used. the patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used. sequential compression devices were also placed. next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone - iodine. pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test. a low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using co2 gas. next, a 12 - mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus. the camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen. next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed. the robot was docked daily and the instruments passed through respective checks. initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially. next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum. at this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered. initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection. it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole. these arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied. next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out. the pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected. sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated. a total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient. at this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis. the proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors. next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section. we then identified the most inferior / dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral - renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion. 3 - 0 monocryl sutures were used to re - anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis. next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2 - 0 monocryl sutures. before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde. this was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter. this was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision. then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2 - 0 monocryl sutures. next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis. good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures. next, gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum. hemostasis appeared excellent at this point. there was no obvious urine extravasation. at this time, the procedure was terminated. the robot was undocked. under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion. then, all skin port sites were closed with 4 - 0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and band - aids were applied over this. also, notably a jackson - pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision. the patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted., disposition :, the patient was discharged to post anesthesia care unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.", Urology

ray views confirmed this., an incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus. this was taken only through subcutaneous tissue. the saphenous vein was found, dissected out. its branches were cauterized. penrose drain was placed around this., dissection was undertaken. the periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint., this was recovered and flipped back on both sides. next, the towel clip was used. ends were freshened up using irrigation. the joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially., anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm k - wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws. anatomic reduction was gained. x - rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction. next, attention was drawn towards the fibula. standard 6 - hole one - third tubular plate was applied to this. again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture. therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used., the posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction. screws were placed. it was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially., screw holes were filled. they were double - checked. screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up. at this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond. this appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia., the screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment., a 2 mm k - wire was used. finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger. x - ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin. this was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed. this was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so. on the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint. ap views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint. one could palpate this as well. the screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane. at the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint. there was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment. wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2 - 0 vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin. adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with kerlix followed by an extensor bandage. posterior splint was placed on the patient. the patient's leg was placed in neutral position. significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma abd type dressings. the heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding. tourniquet was deflated. the patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications. physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied. positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant. as well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue. the patient is expected to do well overall. he does have an area of comminution shown on the ct scan. however, by x - rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment. nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.", Orthopedic

and as i worked to the right of the midline, i encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces. the c5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until i was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen. the root had a somewhat high takeoff but i worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it. again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression. this was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2 - mm cloward punches., attention was then turned to the c5 - c6 space. here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord. i slowly and carefully used the high - speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2 - mm cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord. this necessitated undercutting the bodies of both c5 and c6 extensively, but i was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord. i exposed the c6 root and widely decompressed it until i was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right. the microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved., attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis. a high - speed cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of c5 - c6, c4 - c5 and c3 - c4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration. bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use., attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis. using the various synthes sizers, i selected a 7 - mm lordotic graft at c5 - c6 and an 8 - mm lordotic graft at c4 - c5 and a 9 - mm lordotic graft at c3 - c4. each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge. i decided to use bmp in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks. the bmp sponge and the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft., under distraction, the graft was placed at c3 - c4, c4 - c5, and c5 - c6 as described. an x - ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis., attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation. various sizes of synthes plates were selected until i decided that a 54 - mm plate was appropriate. the plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush. the holes were drilled and the screws were placed. eight screws were placed with two screws at c3, two screws at c4, two screws at c5, and two screws at c6. all eight screws had good purchase. the locking screws were tightly applied. an x - ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws., attention was turned to closure. the wound was copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. a medium hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin. the wound was then carefully closed in layers. sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated., the patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition. the sponge and needle counts were reported as correct. there were no intraoperative complications., specimens were sent to pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue.", Orthopedic

lumen tube., operative procedure in detail :, after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed. in addition, he had a dual - lumen endotracheal tube placed. the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure. his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. after applying sterile dressings, a # 10 - blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus. dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery. the abdomen was opened. next, a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor. next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach. in an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade. we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade. the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2 - 0 silk. we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2 - 0 silk. next, we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver. this was done and the stomach was freed up. we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm. we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest. we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area. the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen. we next turned with our attention to the left gastric artery. the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach. we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties. the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2 - 0 stick tie reinforcement. at this point the stomach was freely mobile. we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube. a 2 - 0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz. we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site. we placed a 16 - french red rubber catheter through this site. we tied down in place. we then used 3 - 0 silk sutures to perform a witzel. next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2 - 0 silk ties. after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen. this was done with # 1 prolene. we put in a 2nd layer of 2 -

muscle - sparing fashion. dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery. next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered. the lung was deflated. we placed standard chest retractors. next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus. we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein. the azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2 - 0 stick ties. as mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus. after doing this, we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring. we used an automatic pursestring and applied. we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors. we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus. the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty. next, we tabularized our stomach using a # 80 gia stapler. after doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery. we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall. we connected our anvil to the eea stapler. this was then secured appropriately. we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition. we then fired the stapler. we obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology. we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology. of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins. we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening. this was closed with 2 - 0 vicryl in a running fashion. we then buttressed this with serosal 3 - 0 vicryl interrupted sutures. we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it. next, we placed two # 28 - french chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis. we then closed the chest with # 2 vicryl in an interrupted figure - of - eight fashion. the lung was brought up. we closed the muscle layers with # 0 vicryl followed by # 0 vicryl ; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2 -

french foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. a midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a # 10 scalpel blade. the rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the bovie. transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. a bookwalter retractor was then placed. the area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. given this patient's low gleason score and low psa with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by manually using the metzenbaum scissors. opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. the dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2 - 0 silk sutures. the deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using allis also and ligated by using 0 vicryl suture in a figure - of - eight fashion. with the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the bovie. deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using metzenbaum scissors. the urethra could then be easily identified. nearly two - third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using metzenbaum scissors. this exposed the blue foley catheter. anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2 - 0 monocryl suture. six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. the foley catheter was then removed. this allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. this effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. the prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. the floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. the prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. the prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. the dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. the prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. the bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. this was developed without any difficulty. both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. the seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. about two - thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. the tip was left behind. using the bipolar gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. this was performed on the left side and then the right side. this completely freed the prostate. the prostate was sent for permanent section. the opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2 - 0 vicryl sutures. the mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4 - 0 chromic sutures. small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. the ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. the previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. this was performed by using a french * * * * * needle. a 20 - french foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. a 15 ml of sterile water was inflated to balloon. the bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. a 19 -

year - old white male, who was diagnosed with a high - grade invasive bladder cancer in june 2005. during the course of his workup of transurethral resection, he had a heart attack when he was taken off plavix after having had a drug - eluting stent placed in. he recovered from this and then underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with a brief response documented by cystoscopy and biopsy after which he had another ischemic event. the patient has been followed regularly by myself and dr. x and has been continuously free of diseases since that time. in that interval, he had a coronary artery bypass graft and was taken off of plavix. most recently, he had a pet ct, which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy, which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated. i took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with findings of a high - grade muscle invasive bladder cancer. we could not identify the right ureteral orifice, and he had a right ureteral stent placed. a metastatic workup was negative and cardiology felt he was at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he was taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy. he was interested in orthotopic neobladder, and i felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue was healthier. therefore, we planned on an indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion., operative findings :, on exploration, there were multiple abnormalities outside the bladder as follows : there were at least three small lesions within the distal small bowel, the predominant one measured about 1. 5 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface. there were two much smaller lesions also with a small white scar, with very little palpable mass. the larger of the two was resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor. there also were changes in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsies of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocytes. the small bowel mesentry was fairly thickened at the base, but no discrete abnormality noted., both common iliac and lymph node samples were very thickened and indurated, and frozen section of the left showed cancer cells that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect ; viability was unable to be determined. there was a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that was negative. the bladder was very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface. the bladder was fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structures. the external iliac lymph nodes were resected on both sides of the obturator ; the lymph packet, however, was very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall, and i elected not to remove that. the rest of the large bowel appeared normal. there were no masses in the liver, and the gallbladder was surgically absent. there was nasogastric tube in the stomach., operative procedure in detail :, the patient was brought to the operative suite, and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine, his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion. the radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter. intravenous antibiotics were given for prophylaxis. we made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deepened through the rectus fascia, and the rectus muscles separated in the midline. exploration was carried out with the findings described. the bladder was adherent and did appear immobile. moist wound towels and a bookwalter retractor was placed for exposure. we began by assessing the small and large bowel with the findings in the small bowel as described. we subsequently resected the largest of the lesions by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a two - layer running 4 - 0 prolene suture. we then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum. the ureters were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis. the right ureter was thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left was of normal caliber. i kept the ureters intact until we were moving the bladder off as described above. at that point, we then ligated the ureters with the rp - 45 vascular load and divided it., we then established the proximal _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ laterally to both genitofemoral nerves and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph nodes. the common iliac lymph nodes remained stuck to the ureter. frozen section with the findings described on the left., i then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally. i was, however, able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node was present in the distal external iliac vessels. clips were used to control the lymphatics distally. these lymph nodes were sent for frozen section, which was negative. we made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessels, but essentially, swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it. the obturator nerve on the right side was sucked into the pelvic sidewall, and i elected not to remove those. on the left side, things were a little bit more mobile in terms of the lymph nodes, but still the obturator lymph nodes were left intact., we then worked on the lateral pedicles on both sides and essentially determined that i can take these down. i then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate. at this point, i scrubbed out of the operation, talked to the family, and indicated that i felt the cystectomy was more palliative than therapeutic, and i reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance., i then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicles with an rp - 45 stapler on the right and clips distally. the endopelvic fascia was incised. i then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior denonvilliers fascia. i intentionally picked down those two pedicles lateral to the rectum between the clips and then turned my attention retropubically. i was able to pass a 0 vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex, tied this, and then, sealed and divided the complex with a ligasure and oversewed it distally with 2 - 0 vicryl figure - of - eight stitch. i then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate, divided the foley catheter between the clamps and then the posterior urethra. i then was able to take down the remaining distal attachments of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum, and the specimen was then free of all attachments and handed off the operative field. the bivalved prostate appeared normal. we then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact. the wound was irrigated with 1 l of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis., we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch. i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon. the colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia - 80 stapler. i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum. the mesentery was then sealed with a ligasure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a gia - 60 stapler. we then performed a side - to - side ileo - transverse colostomy using a gia - 80 stapler, closing the open end with a ta 60. the angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures., we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12 - french robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the gia - 60 stapler. the ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3 - 0 silk sutures as described by rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18 - french robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic "" pop, "" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve., as the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy. we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3 - 0 vicryl sutures. the bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the sgia polysorb - 75. between the staple lines, vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3 - 0 vicryl suture ligatures., we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis. the left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end - to - side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4 - 0 vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a cook 8. 4 - french ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5 - 0 chromic suture. the right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis. we then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2 -

year - old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture. she denied any history of fall or trauma. the presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment. indication, risks, and benefits were discussed. treatment options were reviewed. no guarantees have been made or implied., procedure :, the patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up. the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. a time - out procedure was called. antibiotics were infused., a standard posterolateral approach was made. subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus. this was then incised along the line of the incision. hemostasis was achieved. charnley retractor was positioned. the trochanter was intact. the gluteus medius was well protected with retractor. the piriformis and minimus junction was identified. the minimus was also reflected along with the medius. using bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion. similarly, l - shaped capsulotomy was performed. a # 5 ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair. fracture site was exposed. the femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low - lying basicervical type. femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew. the head size was measured to be 43 mm. bony fragments were removed. the acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated. a 43 - mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability. the specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration. this was sent to the pathology. the fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem. an l - shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis. the basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter. there was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter. the l - shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis. hemostasis was achieved. now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder. the fracture site was well exposed. satisfactory lateralization was performed. attention was for the reaming process. using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal. at this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted. appropriate anteversion was positioned. the anteversion was marked with a bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation. the bony edges were trimmed. the calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well. there was no evidence of any subsidence. at this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length. the relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory. the hip was well reduced without any difficulty. the stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion - adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory. the shuck was less than 1 mm. leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg. stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75 - 80 degrees of internal rotation. similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, i was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees. after verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed. the canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely. at this point, 2 batches of smartset cement with antibiotics were mixed. the definitive ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected. centralizer was positioned. the cement restrictor was inserted. retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried. using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed. the stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured. the excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and freer elevator. all the cement debris was removed., attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head. once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion. it was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory. i also attempted with a - 3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal. the hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation. there was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion - adduction, internal rotation. i also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable. at this point, a definitive component using + 0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced. range of motion and stability was as above. now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis. this was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using # 5 ethibond and suture plaster. satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the # 5 ethibond. the wound was thoroughly irrigated. hemostasis was achieved. the fascia was closed with # 1 vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2 -

open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment. because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under there the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment., procedure in detail :, the patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. a nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line. he was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis. a generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described. moist wound towels and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure. we began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum. the ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips. an identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad., we began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries. this was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally. we then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ and posterior bladder. there was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum. we then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum. we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field. bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis., we then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon. this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension., we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch. i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon. the colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia - 80 stapler. i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum. the mesentery was then sealed with a ligasure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a gia - 60 stapler. we then performed a side - to - side ileo - transverse colostomy using a gia - 80 stapler, closing the open end with a ta 60. the angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures., we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12 - french robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the gia - 60 stapler. the ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3 - 0 silk sutures as described by rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18 - french robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic "" pop, "" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve., as the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy. we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3 - 0 vicryl sutures. the bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the sgia polysorb - 75. between the staple lines, vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3 - 0 vicryl suture ligatures., we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis. the left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end - to - side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4 - 0 vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a cook 8. 4 - french ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5 - 0 chromic suture. the right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis. we then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2 - 0 chromic suture. a 24 - french malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture. the staple lines were then buried with a running 3 - 0 vicryl two - layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture. the pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact., we then made a final inspection for hemostasis. the cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures. we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus. we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this. a portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well - vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3 - 0 chromic sutures. we left an 18 - french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures. the malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion., we matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches. the stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower quadrant. a large jp drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the indiana pouch., the rectus fascia was closed with a buried # 2 prolene running stitch, tying a new figure - of - eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia. subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips. the estimated blood loss was 450 ml, and the patient received no packed red blood cells. the final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct. the patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.", Urology

cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe. the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. the incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. all the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right achilles metatarsal. once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered. gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient., using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions. using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe. although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present. the decision was thus made to perform a youngswick - type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal. the osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a v - pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal. the two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation. the wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to pathology for further examination. the head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the osteomed system. the wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy. the wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16 - mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the osteomed system. the 2 screws were inserted using ao technique. upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed. fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent. the area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction. the cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation. the capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3 - 0 vicryl suture material, 4 - 0 vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues. steri - strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges. at this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated. immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. the patient's surgical site was then covered with xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and kling, stockinette, and ace bandage. the patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels. the patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home. the patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain. the patient was eventually discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with dr. x's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.", Orthopedic

year - old female with a history of previous right bipolar hemiarthroplasty for trauma. this subsequently became infected. she has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer. she currently presents for stage ii reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip., description of procedure :, the patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel. she was placed supine on the operating table. a foley catheter was inserted. a formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site. preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures. the patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up. the previous surgical incision was identified. the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion. the old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent. immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue. dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue. soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring. there was no native tissue to orient oneself with. we carried our dissection down directly through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer. we incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter. dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed. this was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection. the antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur. dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum. a cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure. once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur. this allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum. the acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue. this was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a bovie. once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed. reaming was started with a 46 - mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50 - mm shell. the 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit. attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur. the canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes. some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal. the length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place. following x - rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur. this femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods. the canal was reamed up to 13. 5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem. the stem was selected and initially size a body was placed in trial. the body was too tight proximally to fit. the proximal canal was then reamed for a size aa body. a longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size aa trial was assembled. this fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill. intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position. intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur. the remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed. initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly. we changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner. again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly. this was due to reversion of the femoral component. as we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion. the stem was extracted and retrialed. improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components. a 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell. the real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal. again, the hip was trialed. the components were found to be in relative retroversion. the real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted. again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion. along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts. the femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated. it was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing. decision was made to accept the component position. the real femoral head was selected and implanted. the hip was then taken again to a range of motion. it was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation. the patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly., the wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage. six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure., the wound was then closed in a layered fashion. a hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer. the subcutaneous tissues were closed with # 1 pds, 2 - 0 pds, and staples in the skin. an incisional vac was then placed over the wound as well. sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case., disposition :, the patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.", Orthopedic

aggravation of the low back injury back in october related to his work at abc when he was working unloading and loading an 18 - wheel truck. essentially, there was a clear aggravation of his symptoms with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left. the patient also has increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side. with these ongoing symptoms, the patient has also decrease in activities of daily living such as mobility as well as decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function. therefore, the patient is assigned 8 % impairment of the whole person. we are able to assign this utilizing the fifth edition on spine section on the ama guide. using page 384, table 15 - 3, the patient does fall under dre lumbar category ii under criteria for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury. in this particular section, it states that the patient's clinical history and examination findings are compatible with specific injury ; and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination, a symmetric loss of range of motion, or non - verifiable radicular complaints define his complaints of radicular pain without objective findings ; no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy. the patient also has decrease in activities of daily living ; therefore, the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8 % wpi. in the future, the patient should avoid prolonged walking, standing, stooping, squatting, hip bending, climbing, excessive flexion, extension, and rotation of his back. his one time weight limit should be determined by work trial, although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain. the patient although has a clear low back pain with certain movements such as stooping and extended sitting and does have a clear radicular symptomatology, the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to short -

year - old married male presents complaining of some right periscapular discomfort, some occasional neck stiffness, and some intermittent discomfort in his low back relative to an industrial fall that occurred on november 20, 2008., history of industrial injury :, this patient was injured on november 20, 2008. he works at the purdy correctional facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back. the patient said he primarily landed on the left side. after the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated. he went to a gig harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to tacoma general hospital. at the tacoma general, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a ct scan. the patient describes that he had a brain ct and a dark spot was found. it was recommended that he have a followup mri and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma. before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in october 2005. the patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments. overall his spine complaints have improved substantially., after the fall, he also saw at prompt care in the general bremerton area, xyz, an osteopathic physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from wife xyz. she ordered an mri of his neck. cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at c4 - c5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned., since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, xyz for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck., current symptoms :, the patient describes his current pain as being intermittent., past medical history :, illnesses : the patient had a diagnosis in 2005 of an acoustic neuroma. it was benign, but treated neurosurgically. in february 2004 and again in august 2009 he has had additional treatments for recurrence and he currently has some skull markers in place because radiation is planned as a followup, although the tumor was still indicated to be benign., operations : he has a history of an old mastoidectomy. he has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted., medications : the patient takes occasional tylenol and occasional aleve., substance use :, tobacco : he does not smoke cigarettes., alcohol : he drinks about five beers a week., family history :, his father died of mesothelioma and his mother died of lou gehrig's disease., socioeconomic history :, marital status and dependents : the patient has been married three times ; longest marriage is of two years duration. he has two children. these dependents are ages 15 and twins and are his wife's dependents., education : the patient has bachelor's degree., military history : he served six years in the army and received an honorable discharge., work history : he has worked at purdy correctional institute in gig harbor for 19 years., chart review :, review of the chart indicates a date of injury of november 20, 2008. he was seen at tacoma general hospital with a diagnosis of head contusion and cervical strain. he had a ct of his head done because of a fall with possible loss of consciousness, which showed a left cerebellar hypodensity and further evaluation was recommended. he has a history of an old mastoidectomy. he was then seen on november 24, 2008 by xyz at prompt care on november 24, 2008. there is no clearcut history that he had lost consciousness. he has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. a diagnosis of concussion and cervical strain status post fall was made along with an underlying history of abnormal ct and previous resection of an acoustic neuroma. some symptoms of loss of balance and confusion were noted. she recommended additional testing and neurologic evaluation., the notes from the treating chiropractor begin on november 24, 2008. adjustments are given to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine., he was seen back by xyz on december 9, 2008 and he had been released to full duties. it was recognized the new mri suggested recurrence of the acoustic neuroma and he was advised to seek further care in this regard. there were some concerns of his feeling of being wobbly since the fall which might be related to the recurrent neuroma. he continued to have chiropractic adjustments. he was seen back at prompt care on january 8, 2009. dr. x indicated that she thought most of his symptoms were related to the tumor, but that the cervical and thoracic stiffness were from the fall., a followup note by his chiropractor on january 26, 2009 indicates that cervical x - rays have been taken and that continued chiropractic adjustments along with manual traction would be carried out., on april 13, 2009, he was seen again at prompt care for his cervical and thoracic strain. he was indicated to be improving and there was suggestion that he has some physical therapy and an orthopedic consult was felt appropriate. therapy was not carried out and obviously was then involved with the treatment of his recurrent neuroma., on april 17, 2009, he was seen by dr. x, another chiropractor for consultation and further chiropractic treatments were recommended based on cervical and thoracolumbar subluxation complexes and strain., a repeat consult was carried out on april 29, 2009 by xyz. he felt that this was hyperextension cervical injury. it might take a period of time to recover. he mentioned that the patient might have a slight ulnar neuropathy. he felt the patient was capable of full duty and the patient was at that time having ongoing treatment for his neuroma., this concludes the chart review., physical examination :, the patient is 6 feet in height, weighs 255 pounds., orthopedic examination : he can walk with a normal gait, but he has, as indicated, a positive romberg test and he himself has noticed that if he closes his eyes he loses his balance. overall the patient is a seemingly good historian. there is a visible 3 cm scar at the left base of the neck near the hairline and there are multiple areas where his head has been shaved both anteriorly and posteriorly. these are secondary to drawing for the skull markers. there is a scar behind the patient's left ear from the original treatment of the acoustic neuroma. this was well healed. the patient can perform a toe - heel gait without difficulty. one visibly can see that he has some facial asymmetry and he indicates that the acoustic neuroma has caused some numbness in the left side of his face and also some asymmetry that is now recovering. the patient states he now thinks his recovery is going to get disregarded and that the facial asymmetry and numbness developed from the first surgery he had. the patient has a full range of motion in both of his shoulders. the patient has a full range of motion in his lumbar spine to include 90 degrees of forward bend, lateral bending of 30 degrees in either direction and extension of 10 degrees. there is full range of motion in the patient's cervical spine to include flexion of 50 degrees at which time he can touch his chin on his chest. he extends 40 degrees, laterally bends 30 degrees, and rotates to 80 degrees in either direction. there is slight tenderness on palpating over the right cervical musculature. there is no evidence of any cervical or lumbar muscle spasms. reflexes in the upper extremities include 1 + biceps and triceps and 1 + brachioradialis. knee jerks are 2 + and ankle jerks are 1 +. tinel's test was tested at the elbow, it is negative bilaterally with percussion ; however, he has slight tingling bilaterally. the patient's grip tested with a jamar dynamometer increases from 70 to 80 pounds bilaterally. sensory testing of lower extremities reveal that the patient has slightly decreased sensation to sharp stimulus in his dorsal aspect of the right first toe and a lesser extent to the left. testing of muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities is normal. the patient upper arms measured four fingerbreadths above the flexion crease of the elbow measure 35 cm bilaterally. the forearms measured four fingerbreadths below the flexion crease of the elbow measure 30 cm bilaterally. the thighs measured four fingerbreadths above the superior pole of the patella measure 48 cm and the lower legs measured four fingerbreadths below the tibial tubercles measure 41 cm. pressure on the vertex of the head does not bother the patient. axial loading is negative. as already indicated straight leg raising is entirely negative both sitting and lying for any radiculitis., diagnostic studies :, x - rays the patient brings with him taken by his treating chiropractor dated 11 / 24 / 08 showed that there appears to be a little bit of narrowing of the l4 - 5 disc space. the hip joints are normal. views of his thoracic spine are normal. cervical x - rays are in the file. these are of intermittent quality, but the views do show a very slight degree of anterior spurring at the c4 - 5 with possible slight narrowing of the disc. there is a view of the right shoulder that is unremarkable., conclusions :, the accepted condition under the claim is a sprain of the neck, thoracic, and lumbar., diagnoses :, diagnosis based on today's examination is a sprain of the cervical spine and lumbar spine superimposed upon some early degenerative changes., additional diagnosis is one of recurrent acoustic neuroma, presumably benign with upcoming additional treatment of radiation plan. the patient also has a significant degree overweight for his height and it will be improved as he himself recognizes by some weight loss and exercise., discussion :, he is fixed and stable at this time and his industrial case can be closed relative to his industrial injury of november 20, 2008. further chiropractic treatments would be entirely palliative and serve no additional medical purpose due to the fact that he has very minimal symptoms and a basis for these symptoms based on mild or early degenerative changes in both cervical and lumbar spine. he is category i relative to the cervical spine under 296 - 20 - 240 and category i to the lumbosacral spine under wac 296 - 20 - 270. his industrial case should be closed and there is, as indicated, no basis for any disability award.", Orthopedic
615,"history :, the patient is a 52 - year - old female with a past medical history of diet - controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few - month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves. symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago. this normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time. she was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms. she is almost asymptomatic at present. she dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs. she has had no associated weakness., on brief examination, straight leg raising is normal. the patient is obese. there is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities. strength is full and symmetric. deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2 + and symmetric and absent at the ankles., nerve conduction studies :, bilateral sural sensory responses are absent. bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced. the right radial sensory response is normal. the right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal. bilateral h - reflexes are absent., needle emg :, needle emg was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle. it revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle. lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment., impression :, this electrical study is abnormal. it reveals the following :, 1. a very mild, purely sensory length - dependent peripheral neuropathy., 2. mild bilateral l5 nerve root irritation. there is no evidence of active radiculopathy., based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral l5 radiculopathies. symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting elavil. tentatively i would recommend mri of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return. with respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance / early diabetes. however, i would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following : fasting blood sugar, hba1c, esr, rpr, tsh, b12, serum protein electrophoresis and lyme titer.", Radiology

618,"history of present illness :, the patient is a 79 - year - old right - handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom. at that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell. he reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him. he was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal., he was then well until the 3rd of july 2008 when his legs again gave way on him. this was not preceded by lightheadedness. he was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia. he started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day. he again had a fall in august of 2008 after his legs gave way. again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this. he was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this. he did not, however, return to the pre - july baseline. in october of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles. he is currently in a chronic rehabilitation unit. he cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything. he states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks. he is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands. he does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since july 2008, but it is clearly getting worse. he has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in august 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs. he does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing. he reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder. he has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel approximately presyncopal when he stands. he also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges. this has been present for about nine months. he has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months., past medical history :, 1. pneumonia. he has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20. these have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year. he is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged. there is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia., 2. he has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement. the patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems. he has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month., 3. he had an appendectomy in the 1940s., 4. he had an ankle resection in 1975., social history :, the patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars. he has not smoked for the past 27 years. he hardly ever uses alcohol. he is currently retired., family history :, there is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases. his aunt has a history of type ii diabetes., current medications :, fludrocortisone 0. 1 mg p. o. q. d., midodrine 5 mg p. o. q. i. d., cymbalta 30 mg p. o. per day, prilosec 20 mg p. o. per day, lortab 10 mg p. o. per day, amoxil 500 mg p. o. per day, vitamin b12 1000 mcg weekly, vitamin d 1000 units per day, metamucil p. r. n., enteric -

ray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate. an x - ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis. a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55 % stenosis. the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis. there was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted. an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration. there was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis. this was an essentially normal brain mri. a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11. 3, a low red cell count of 3. 43, elevated mch of 32. 4 and the rest of the study was normal. an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8. 3, and a low protein of 5. 2 and albumin of 3. 1. the glucose was 86. tsh performed in january 2009 was 1. 57, which is within the normal range. vitamin b12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18. 2, which was normal. a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect. the ecg was non - diagnostic. there was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle. the left ventricular ejection fraction was 68 %, which is within the normal range for males. a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broad - based disc bulge at l1 - l2, l2 - l3, l3 - l4 and l4 - l5. at l5 - s1, in addition to the broad - based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis. there was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5 - s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1 - l4. an echocardiogram was performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation., diagnostic impression :, the patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings. he is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities. his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia. according to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008. as indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy. there was no involvement of the tongue on emg. the laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy. we are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the mayo clinic. this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as sle, sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease. in addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents. the patient did not receive any of these. it may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18 - pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking. we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation. the verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer. we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm. the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm. this showed evidence of severe axonal loss. there was no evidence of a vasculitis. the vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis. there were a few perivascular changes ; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections. the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping. again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis. evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy. specifically, there is no history of hiv exposure. we would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis. at this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed. i have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son. we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy. i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder., there is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as charcot - marie - tooth disease type 2. however, since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this., plan :, 1. nerve conduction and emg will be performed today. the results were indicated above., 2. the following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, cbc, thyroid function tests, b12, ana, c - reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double - stranded dna antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin a1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, p - anca, c - anca, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the mayo clinic, b12. these studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0. 74, low calcium of 8. 6, low total protein of 5. 7. the b12 was greater than 2000. the immunoelectrophoresis, ana, double -

related injury some time in 1998. at that time, he was driving an 18 - wheeler truck. the patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer. he experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of l4 - l5 and l5 - s1. the patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember. he was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work - related injury in may of 2005. at that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain - pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles. mr. xyz felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital. he was mri'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re - herniation of an l5 - s1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in houston, where he underwent fusion by dr. w from l3 through s2. this was done on 12 / 15 / 2005. initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left - sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot. he is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and caused significant weakness in his left leg. the patient was referred to dr. a, pain management specialist and dr. a has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of norco 10 / 325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t. i. d. with lunesta 3 mg q. h. s . for sleep, carisoprodol 350 mg t. i. d., and lyrica 100 mg q. daily. the patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required. he has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal. the patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05 / 22 / 06 by tir rehab center. at that time, it was felt that mr. xyz showed a degree of moderate level of depression. there were no indications in the evaluation that mr. xyz showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors. it was felt at that time that mr. xyz would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications. of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes. mr. xyz indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health - related issues because of financial limitations. he still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes. the impression was that the patient had axis iv diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis iii diagnosis. this was done by rhonda ackerman, ph. d., a psychologist. it was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking. despite these evaluations, mr. xyz really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of ssris. of concern in june of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings. his hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls. it was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time. in september of 2006, the patient was evaluated at baylor college of medicine in the occupational health program. the evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record. evaluation was done by dr. b. at present, mr. xyz continues on with his oxycodone and norco. these were prescribed by dr. a two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks. the patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain. he is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited. he spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching tv and occasionally will walk a while. * * * * * from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero. the patient denies smoking at this time. he denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use. he obtains no pain medications from no other sources. review of mri done on 02 / 10 / 06 shows laminectomies at l3 through s1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left l4 -

637,"rice, stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries - - - rest, ice, compression, and elevation., rest :, stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing., ice :, ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. this contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. the more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. ice can be safely applied in many ways :, * for injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve., * for injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. to make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. place the ice pack over the cloth. the pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place., * ice the injured area for about 30 minutes., * remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes., * reapply the ice., * repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. if pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. you may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. at that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable., compression :, compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. to apply compression safely sensitivity to an injury :, * use an elasticized bandage ( ace bandage ) for compression, if possible. if you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time., * wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site., * be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. then rewrap the area - - less tightly this time., elevation :, elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.", Orthopedic

however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments ; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial. based on this, i did total decompression by removing the lamina of c3 through both c6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at c3 - c4, c4 - c5, c5 - c6, and c6 - c7 with no spinal instrumentation. operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery. risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection. there is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord. this may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma. there is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of csf leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis. this too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair. the patient understood the risk of the surgery. i told him there is just a 30 % chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery ; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed., description of procedure :, the patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. after smooth induction and intubation, a foley catheter was inserted. monitoring leads were also placed by premier neurodiagnostics for both ssep and emg monitoring. the sseps were normal, and the emgs were silent during the entire case. after completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support. shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region. all pressure points were padded. i proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision. this was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with duraprep., after sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade # 10. wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar. dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of c2 was then identified. there was absence of the spinous process of c3, c4, c5, and c6, but partial laminectomy was noted ; removal of only 15 % of the lamina. with this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at c3, c4, c5, and c6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery. there was also a dural tear on the right c3 - c4 space that was exposed and repaired with prolene 6 - 0 and later with tisseel. by careful dissection and the use of a - 5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at c3 - c4, c4 - c5, c5 - c6, and c6 - c7. there was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated. at two points, i had to pack this with small pieces of gelfoam. after repair of the dural tear, valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any csf leakage. area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with tisseel. the wound was then closed in layers with vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia ;

anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. an esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmhg on the left thigh. a longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum. a medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle. care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated. the proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line. again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia. the intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed. rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size e. at this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation. the anterior cutting guide was then placed. care was checked for the amount of muscle resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur. after this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed. the left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a

dependant diabetic. he is also has end - stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis. additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation. he has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity. however, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger. these started initially as unrecognized paper cuts. additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger. finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger. thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary. thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of "" ping - pong ball sign "" due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers. however, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time., the patient has now also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks. thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. this patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel., description of procedure :, after general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous ancef. the entire left upper extremity is prepped with betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion. a sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm. the arm is then exsanguinated with ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmhg. i started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease. dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal. i next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm. having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, i next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel. the synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so. there was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression. the motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified. the contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified. the wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5 - 0 nylon sutures., i next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle. dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass. in the process of elevating this skin flap i elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap. i now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until i identified the median nerve., i turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and i dissected it all the way proximally until i encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm. the entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised. the ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures. larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips. i continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the fcu muscle fibers. the nerve is now mobilized and i had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques. in this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner., i now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension - free manner. because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other. so that in effect a lengthening is performed. fascial repair is done with interrupted figure - of - eight 0 - ethibond sutures. i now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension - free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve. the entire arm is next wrapped with a kerlix wrap and i released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, i then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis. wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15 - french round blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound. a layered wound closure is done with interrupted vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular monocryl to the skin. a 0. 25 % plain marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of adaptic impregnated bacitracin ointment, followed by a well -

retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field. bovie cautery was used for hemostasis. at this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one - third of the greater trochanter. at this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally. the tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor. at this time, after hemostasis was obtained, bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius. at this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule. a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle. once this was performed, homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck. at this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ and then edged over the acetabulum. at this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum. at this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum. at this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut. we made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter. at this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut., the femoral head was then removed. at this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum. a long - handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum. with better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum. we started with a size # 44 and progressively reamed to a size # 50. at the size # 50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum. we then reamed up to size # 52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum. a size 54 mm trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in. once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum. at this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup. at this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection. the leg was then placed back in the bag. a bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur. a rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter. a box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck. a charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal. a power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem. at this time, we began broaching. we started with a size # 10 and progressively worked up to a size # 12 mm broach. once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar. a calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly. a standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed. once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation. at this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum. this was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening. once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time. we copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry. at this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place. once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none. the 28 mm zero neck length cobalt - chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the morse taper assured that this was well fixed by _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _., next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion. we were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components. copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound. # 1 ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule. # 1 ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter. next, a # 1 ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure - of - eight closure. a tight closure was performed. since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple # 2 - 0 vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then # 2 - 0 vicryl for the subcutaneous skin. staples were then used for skin closure. the patient's hip was then cleansed. sterile dressings consisting of adaptic, 4 x 4, abds, and foam tape were then placed. a drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage. after the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition. prognosis is good.", Orthopedic

however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized. the redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor. working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex. it was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex. the brainstem was identified above the complex. similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain. attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex. there were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area. the lateral pontine vein was maintained. microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem. a number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane. this then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed. a number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve. cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out. the nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this. the tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off. the cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus. the tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus. at this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus. there was minimal bulk remaining intracranially. all the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem. dr. x then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus., i then scrubbed back into case once dr. x had completed removing this portion of the tumor. there was no tumor remaining at this point. i placed some norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated. an intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly. there was no bleeding. the nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time. the dura was then closed with 4 - 0 nurolons in interrupted fashion. a muscle plug was used over one area. duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by hemaseel. gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out. the wound was then irrigated thoroughly. o vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3 - 0 vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3 - 0 nylon on the skin., the patient was extubated and taken to the icu in stable condition.", Neurology

938,"history of present illness :, the patient is a 35 - year - old woman who reports that on the 30th of october 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic. i do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours. she was sitting up during the epidural., she did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural ; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time. she delivered on the 31st of october, by cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia., she also had a foley catheter placed at that time. on the 1st of november 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk. she was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all. since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg. she is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand. she was discharged from hospital after the cesarean section on the 3rd of november. unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge. she was then seen at abc hospital on november 05, 2008. she had an mri scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma. she also had an emg study at that time by dr. x, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in december. at the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs. she complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there. she has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on receiving a very low dose and the effect is minimal. she has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal. there is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function., past medical history :, unremarkable except as noted above. she has seasonal allergies., current medications :, gabapentin 300 mg b. i. d., centrum once a day, and another multivitamin., allergies :, she has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies., family history :, there is a family history of diabetes and hypertension. there is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease. she has one child, a son, born on october 31, 2008., social history :, the patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home. she is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby. she does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either., general physical examination :, vital signs : p 74, bp 144 / 75, and a pain score of 0., general : her general physical examination was unremarkable., cardiovascular : normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume., respiratory : unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal., gi : unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds., neurological exam :, mse : the patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long - term recall was normal. executive function was normal., cranial nerves : the cranial nerve examination ii through xii was unremarkable. both disks were normal, with normal retina. pupils were equal and reactive to light. eye movements were full. facial sensation and strength was normal. bulbar function was normal. the trapezius had normal strength., motor : muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities. muscle strength was 5 / 5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities. in the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1 / 5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1 / 5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1 / 5 and on the left was 3 -

to - nose testing was normal. coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities., gait : the patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or romberg's. there was no evidence of focal back tenderness., review of outside records :, i have reviewed the records from abc hospital, including the letter from dr. y and the emg report dated 12 / 17 / 2008 from dr. x. the emg report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately t6. the lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal ; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency. i do have the mri of lumbar spine report from 11 / 06 / 2008 with and without contrast. this showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of l4 - l5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable. the patient brought a disc with a most recent mri study ; however, we were unable to open this on our computers. the verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots. a doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. chest x - ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities. a ct pelvis study performed on november 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to l4 and l5 levels ; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities. we were able to obtain an update of the report from the mri of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12 / 30 / 2008. the complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. there was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in november. it was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities., impression :, the patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of october 2008, prior to her cesarean section. it appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function. she was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left. there has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of november 2008. her emg study from the end of december is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy. the mri findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural. there had been no response to iv methylprednisolone given to her at abc. the issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both abc and by myself. the patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition. at the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk. there is no evidence on her previous emg of a demyelinating neuropathy., recommendations :, 1. the diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length. she is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain., 2. she is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory. if she is able to walk, she will need bilateral afos for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility. i am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them., 3. we discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin. the paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain. if this is the case, i have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b. i. d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day. she may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed. she will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage., 4. the patient will follow up with dr. y and his team at abc hospital. she will also continue with physical therapy within the abc system.", Neurology

0 vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion. a medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous. next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with # 4 - 0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. next, the skin was closed with # 5 - 0 monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion., attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature. there was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted. a linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length. the incision was deepened with # 15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue. next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures., next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a # 15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint. the tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally. the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound. the bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded. the base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal - appearing cartilage. a sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare. next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected. a 0. 045 inch kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft. the toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position. an extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed. the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline. a # 3 - 0 vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis. a # 4 - 0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique. the wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion., attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated. the same suture material was used and the same 0. 045 kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation., attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated. the same suture material was used. however, a 0. 062 kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0. 045 kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight. next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well. a linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a # 10 blade approximately 2 cm in length. a # 15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected. the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound. a sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare. the toe assumed to more rectus position. the reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces. the joint was again flushed with saline. next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with # 3 - 0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. the skin was closed with # 4 - 0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique., next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin. a # 10 blade was used to make a 2. 5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head. the incision was deepened with a # 15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue. any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery. care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively. next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a # 15 blade. the capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a # 15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound. hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly. a sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone. a reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces. next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline. the capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with # 3 - 0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with # 4 - 0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. a bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures. the skin was closed with # 5 - 0 monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion. the _ _ _ _ _ _ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with # 5 - 0 monocryl. attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated. therefore, a # 15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon. the tendon was transected. next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed. next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position. one # 4 - 0 nylon suture was placed in the skin., mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds. betadine - soaked owen silk was applied to all wounds. betadine - soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes. the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. all the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped. a standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, kling, kerlix, and coban were applied. the patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. she was transported via cart to the postanesthesia care unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. she was given prescription for tylenol # 3, # 40 one to two p. o. q. 4 -

brief history :, the patient is a 68 - year - old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years. she had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility. she had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery., procedure :, the patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table. department of anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic. once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position. care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position. once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmhg on the right thigh. at this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum. a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface. there was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, later intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well. at this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed. this was done without difficulty. attention was then directed removing the femoral component. osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed. after this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component. an osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose. there was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation. this was evaluated. the bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component. the attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the zimmer stemmed component. at this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut. we elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut. we elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12. at this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed. care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis. once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made. this allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally. the anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide. the anterior surface cutting block was then placed. this aligned us to anterior cutting block., we ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis. once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made. it was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on. this allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur. once this was placed and pinned in position. care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut. it was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone. the posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects. this was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component. after all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed. this appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position. it appeared to be satisfactory. at this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia. the intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _ _ _ _ _ _ _ was obtained. at this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut. this appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface. the cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component. at this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone. this was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component. this was placed in a proper position. a 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion. this was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position. we elected to take an intraoperative x - ray at this point, to evaluate our cut. the intraoperative x - ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis. at this point, all trials were removed. the patella was then examined. the rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium. the patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone. it was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed. at this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed. there was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes. these were removed with a rongeur., at this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes. approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried. the tourniquet was then reinflated. the canals were prepped for cementing. they were suction - dried and cleaned. the tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial. once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component. the stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented. again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation. a size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression. this was then taken through extension and held until cement cured. this was then removed and the components were evaluated. all excess cement was removed and they were well fixed. size 14 mm trial poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion. this was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability. it was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm poly. this gave us extra poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion. the final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ secured. the knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion. the patella was tracking with no - touch technique and adequately positioned. at this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. all bleeding was cauterized using a bovie cautery. the retinaculum was then repaired using # 1 ethibond in a figure - of - eight fashion. this was reinforced with a running # 2 - 0 vicryl. the knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment. the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. a drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage. at this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with # 2 - 0 vicryl. skin was approximated with skin clips. sterile dressing of adaptic, 4x4, webril, and abds were then placed. a large dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity. the patient was then
