 Neurology,"CC:, Confusion and slurred speech.,HX , (primarily obtained from boyfriend): This 31 y/o RHF experienced a ""flu-like illness 6-8 weeks prior to presentation. 3-4 weeks prior to presentation, she was found ""passed out"" in bed, and when awoken appeared confused, and lethargic. She apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation she demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of her ( outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). She left a stove on.,She began slurring her speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation she developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. She denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma.,PMH:, Migraine Headache.,FHX: , Unremarkable.,SHX: ,Divorced. Lives with boyfriend. 3 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH.,ROS:, Irregular menses.,EXAM: ,BP118/66.  HR83. RR 20. T36.8C.,MS: Alert and oriented to name only. Perseverative thought processes. Utilized only one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name.,CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold only.,Motor: Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength.,Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities.,Coordination: difficult to assess.,Station: Right pronator drift.,Gait: unremarkable.,Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally.,General Exam: unremarkable.,INITIAL STUDIES:, CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified).,COURSE: ,MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable.,She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications.,In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer."
 Urology,"PROCEDURE: , Elective male sterilization via bilateral vasectomy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Fertile male with completed family.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Fertile male with completed family.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Anesthesia is local with conscious sedation.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,INDICATIONS:  ,This 34-year-old gentleman has come to the office requesting sterilization via bilateral vasectomy.  I discussed the indications and the need for procedure with the patient in detail, and he has given consent to proceed.  He has been given prophylactic antibiotics.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , Once satisfactory sedation have been obtained, the patient was placed in the supine position on the operating table.  Genitalia was shaved and then prepped with Betadine scrub and paint solution and were draped sterilely.  The procedure itself was started by grasping the right vas deferens in the scrotum, and bringing it up to the level of the skin.  The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath.  The vas was brought out of the incision carefully.  A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed.  The free ends were cauterized and were tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves.  After securing hemostasis with a cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized.,Attention was now turned to the left side.  The vas was grasped and brought up to the level of the skin.  The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath.  The vas was brought out of the incision carefully.  A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed.  The free ends were cauterized and tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves.  After securing hemostasis with the cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized.,Bacitracin ointment was applied as well as dry sterile dressing.  The patient was awakened and was returned to Recovery in satisfactory condition."
 Urology,"INDICATION:,  Prostate Cancer.,TECHNIQUE:,  3.5 hours following the intravenous administration of 26.5 mCi of Technetium 99m MDP, the skeleton was imaged in the anterior and posterior projections.,FINDINGS:,  There is a focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull.  The uptake in the remainder of the skeleton is within normal limits.  The kidneys image normally.  There is increased activity in the urinary bladder suggesting possible urinary retention.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull.  CT scanning of magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and brain could be done for further assessment if it is clinically indicated.,2.  There is probably some degree of urinary retention.,"
 Urology,"DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was placed in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The left vas was grasped in between the fingers.  The skin and vas were anesthetized with local anesthesia.  The vas was grasped with an Allis clamp.  Skin was incised and the vas deferens was regrasped with another Allis clamp.  The sheath was incised with a scalpel and elevated using the iris scissors and clamps were used to ligate the vas deferens.  The portion in between the clamps was excised and the ends of the vas were clamped using hemoclips, two in the testicular side and one on the proximal side.  The incision was then inspected for hemostasis and closed with 3-0 chromic catgut interrupted fashion.,A similar procedure was carried out on the right side.  Dry sterile dressings were applied and the patient put on a scrotal supporter.  The procedure was then terminated."
 Urology,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Voluntary sterility.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Voluntary sterility.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  Bilateral vasectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,A gentleman who is here today requesting voluntary sterility.  Options were discussed for voluntary sterility and he has elected to proceed with a bilateral vasectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, and after appropriately identifying the patient, the patient was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion and placed in a supine position on the OR table.  Then, 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was used to anesthetize the scrotal skin.  A small incision was made in the right hemiscrotum.  The vas deferens was grasped with a vas clamp.  Next, the vas deferens was skeletonized.  It was clipped proximally and distally twice.  The cut edges were fulgurated.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained.  Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin on the right hemiscrotum.  Next, the attention was turned to the left hemiscrotum, and after the left hemiscrotum was anesthetized appropriately, a small incision was made in the left hemiscrotum.  The vas deferens was isolated.  It was skeletonized.  It was clipped proximally and distally twice.  The cut edges were fulgurated.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained.  Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin.  A jockstrap and sterile dressing were applied at the end of the case.  Sponge, needle, and instruments counts were correct."
